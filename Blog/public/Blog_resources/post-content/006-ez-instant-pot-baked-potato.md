## Ingredients Needed for Instant Pot Potatoes

Only 3 simple ingredients are needed here! This recipe is the perfect easy foundation. From there, you are free to add whatever toppings you like! Check out my tips below for delicious flavor combinations.

* **Potatoes**: I like to use russet potatoes in this recipe. They have a high starch content which makes them light and fluffy when baked. Yukon gold potatoes are also a great substitute.
* **Water**: Adding water to your instant pot is going to help them steam to perfection.
* **Sea Salt:** I love the texure of sea salt and the way it enhances a baked potato's overall flavor. I sprinkle this on top after the baked potatoes are done cooking.
* **Olive Oil Spray**: Using olive oil spray is an optional step, but if you want your potatoes a little crispier, this is perfect for achieving that.

## How to Make Instant Pot Baked Potatoes

This recipe is so incredibly easy, it really is the most foolproof way to make baked potatoes. The Instant Pot does all of the heavy lifting to simplify your life a little bit!

1. **Prepare Instant Pot and Potatoes**: To start, place the metal trivet into the instant pot. Prepare the potatoes by scrubbing them and piercing them all over with a fork.
2. **Add Water and Potatoes**: Next, pour the water into the instant pot and place the potatoes on top. If needed, you can stack them on top of each other.
3. **Begin Pressure Cooking**: Close the lid and set it to the sealed position. Press the manual/pressure cook to high and cook for 12 minutes for small potatoes, 15 minutes or medium and 18 for large potatoes.
4. **Release Pressure**: Let the pressure release naturally. Then, quick release any remaining pressure and carefully open the top.
5. **(Optional Step) If You Want Potato Skins Crispy**: Lay your potatoes on a baking sheet and spray with olive oil spray. Next, place in the oven and turn on high broil for 3-4 minutes or until the skin is slightly crisp. Sprinkle the potatoes with some sea salt and serve as desired.

### Tips and Tricks for the Best Instant Pot Baked Potatoes

This recipe is beyond easy as-is, but a few simple tips and tricks can make your baked potatoes taste out of this world! The result is fluffy golden goodness that your family is sure to be drooling over.

* **Dry Potatoes**: It is really important to wash the dirt off of your potatoes before you cook them. But one mistake that is often overlooked is to dry them completely before use. If there is too much moisture on your potato, it can seep into the skins and prevent them from crisping.
* **Crispy Skins**: If you want baked potatoes with perfectly crispy skins that still have a soft fluffy inside, don't skip the broiling step! A quick spritz of olive oil spray and broiling your potatoes for a few minutes is just what they need for the best texture possible.
* **Making Sure Your Potatoes Are Ready to Eat**: Once your timer goes off, you will want to make sure your potatoes are cooked through completely. One surefire way to check is by inserting a toothpick. If you are able to insert and remove it easily, your potato is ready to eat!
* **Cut Your Potatoes Immediately**: It's common sense to want to let your potatoes cool down completely before cutting them open, but unfortunately, letting them sit will alter their texture. Unless you cut them open immediately, the insides will continue to cook and retain water, ultimately becoming more dense rather than fluffy.

### Baked Potato Toppings

The sky is the limit when it comes to adding toppings! My go-to is always a little butter, salt and pepper, bacon bits, and sour cream. I also love baked potatoes topped with [alfredo sauce](https://therecipecritic.com/the-best-homemade-alfredo-sauce-ever/)– that's a close second. You can also make your baked potatoes the meal itself! Top them with [chili](https://therecipecritic.com/chili-recipe/), [curry](https://therecipecritic.com/vegetable-curry/), or even [BBQ sauce](https://therecipecritic.com/bbq-sauce-recipe/) and [pulled pork](https://therecipecritic.com/slow-cooker-sweet-carolina-pulled-pork-sliders/)!

### Storing Leftover Baked Potatoes

Instant pot-baked potatoes are best when fresh, but can also be stored and enjoyed a few days after. This makes them a perfect, easy side for a quick dinner!

* **In the Refrigerator**: Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Make sure your baked potatoes are completely cooled before storing!
* **In the Freezer**: You can freeze baked potatoes without any butter or toppings on them. Wrap them tightly in aluminum foil, place in a ziplock bag, and store for 1-2 months. Let thaw overnight before reheating.
* **Reheating**: Pop your baked potatoes in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10-15 minutes or until warmed through.
