* **Flour:** I used all purpose flour for this recipe!
* **Salt and pepper**: I used this right before baking to season the nuggets.
* **Olive oil:** If you don't have any olive oil the you can use melted butter instead!
* **Garlic:**Mince up some fresh garlic cloves. If you don't have any, you can use minced garlic from your fridge. ½ tsp equals about 1 clove of garlic!
* **Panko:**The pank bread crumbs give these chicken nuggets the best crispy texture.
* **Parmesan:** This adds to that crispy texture and tastes delicious.
* **Dried parsley:**I like to used parsley to flavor it. It gives a similar taste to restaurant nuggets!
* **Paprika:**Paprika is a sweet spice that I love to use in this coating.

### Air Fryer Tips

If you have never used an air fryer before or you have but want some tips, then this should help! I have come up with a few of my top air frying tips for you! It will make this so much easier!

* **Preheat:** If you heat up the airfryer before you use it to cook with, then it will help your food be crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Just turn your air fryer to the temperature of your recipe and leave it like that for at least 5 minutes before putting any food in it!
* **Don't overlap:**When I place things in the airfryer, I make sure that they are in a single layer and don't overlap. This may take a few more batches of cooking but it will be worth it. If you stack your food then it sticks together and becomes mushy. Then it won't cook poroperly and won't be crispy!
* **Less oil:** It seems like it would be the opposite but less oil is better. The less olive oil that you use on your food the crispier it will be!
* **Dont forget to flip:**Make sure that halfway through cooking, you take the tray out of the air fryer and shake it and flip the nuggets. Then they get cooked evenly and they will be fully crisp!
* **Olive oil:** Use regular oil instead of extra virgin olive oil. This is becaue the extra virgin olive oil will smoke a lot more!
