It has now been close to five years that I have been living in Germany. The last five years have been extremely eventful. I have learned a new language, lived with Germans, made many friends, traveled within the country, celebrated many festivals, taught Yoga in a studio here and done much more than what can even be put on a list like this.

There have been moments when I have been bewildered by German rules, excited at the start of spring or snow season, hated everything when I missed my home country too much – but most of my moments were spent enjoying  the joy of living in this country.

If you're on this page, then most likely you are considering moving to another country. Is Germany the country for you? Read on to see my experience of living in Germany. 

## Germany is a Country Full of Rules

Every country has rules for everything, but not everyone follows them. In many cases, the people aren't even aware of the rules in the first place. Things run very differently in Germany. **In fact, things run exactly the way they should.**

There is a reason why public systems or many other processes run very efficiently in Germany. It is because the people have a very high regard for the rules and hardly ever break them. There is a process for everything and it is black and white hence highly efficient. If only every other country functioned like this, the world would have been very different. 

If you break a rule in Germany, then it is very likely that a fellow resident will point it out to you instead of turning a blind eye. Take it with a smile because they are just trying to help you.

## Mountains, Castles, Forests: Germany is Insanely Pretty

Posing Outside Disney's Cinderella Castle – Burg Eltz, Germany

Germany has the alps, the North Sea coast, the Baltic sea coast, insanely beautiful national parks and stunning castles. Germany has the best of nature and the most interesting cities. 

If you like big cities then you're going to love [Hamburg](https://drifterplanet.com/things-to-do-in-hamburg-germany/) and [Berlin](https://drifterplanet.com/east-side-gallery-berlin/). If you're looking for stunning castle destinations then [Burg Eltz](https://drifterplanet.com/burg-eltz-castle-germany/) and [Heidelberg](https://drifterplanet.com/things-to-do-in-heidelberg-germanys/) will steal your heart. If you want to see beaches then you will love [Reugan Island](https://drifterplanet.com/jasmund-national-park-rugen-island-germany/) on the Baltic coast and North Sea destinations. 

Everyone is aware of Bavaria's beauty – the clear lakes, Bavarian Alps and lovely small towns. But honestly most of the small towns all over Germany are lovely because of an "old town", castles, protected forest area and more.

## Germany's Trash Management is Crazy Awesome

Yeah so almost every developed country and some developing countries have a trash management system that starts with people segregating their trash, but things are a little too extreme in Germany. 

Broadly speaking, all households need to sort out their trash into bio, plastic, paper, diaper, glass, old batteries, old electronics, paint, and drink bottles. Yes, you need to segregate trash in these categories in your house.  This is a very broad bifurcation because there are many "if"s and "but"s to this segregation in terms of rules. 

There are recycling boxes for old clothes and shoes in many parts of the city so you can get rid of everything that you don't use as long as you plan accordingly.

I don't know if there's any country that beats Germany in terms of trash management but I have heard that the Scandinavian countries are pretty good too.

## Clean Air and Forest Reserves

Germany is so green

I love how Germany as a country protects and preserves the environment. The country is full of forests. There are plenty of nature reserves and they aren't just close to small towns but also big cities. Yes, you could be living in a busy city on some 4th floor of an apartment building but you may still be able to find a small forest reserve nearby where you can go for a run and feel alive in the nature. 

## Everything is Closed on Sundays (+ Holidays)

In most of the countries, offices are closed on Sundays but the big shopping areas are open because that's when a lot of people finally get the time to step out and buy things. Of course, the things are very different in Germany. Here everything is shut on Sundays. Really, everything.

It took me some time to get used to the fact that there is one day in a week where almost all the shops are closed. Sometimes there is a holiday that's on Monday or Saturday, so one has to be prepared for two days of supermarket closure and buy the important things from before.

This required a bit of planning from me in the beginning because in India the stores are open literally everyday. Even on Diwali. Yes, this is one of the things that I miss about [living in India](https://drifterplanet.com/life-in-india-is-awesome/).

## Drinking in Public is Normal

Drinking in Public in Germany is very normal

Yes, shockingly you can drink beer in many public areas in Germany, including trains. **No, that doesn't mean you see wasted people everywhere.**

[German people](https://drifterplanet.com/things-i-learned-about-german-people-after-moving-to-germany/) know how to handle their alcohol well because beer is a very important part of their culture. They seem to respect the social decorum and you'd hardly ever seen anyone overdoing it unless it is a special occasion. But yes, occasionally you will see people who are drunk as hell. 

## No Work After Hours: Work Life Balance is Super

Do you have a 9-5 job? It is highly likely that you don't leave your workplace at exactly 5 everyday. It can be 5:15 on some days or 4:50 on the others. Even after you leave work, it is likely that on some days your team or colleagues will call you or email you about some important work. It is very normal to work after the hours in most countries. It sucks!

Having experienced corporate life in India and the US, the German way of working came as a pleasant surprise to me. If someone's work ends at 5 pm here, the person WILL leave at 5 pm, and not a minute after that. No boss will call or email after the work hours or on a weekend. That just doesn't happen in Germany, unless it is a highly exceptional case. 

This system really works well in Germany because [Germans are highly efficient](https://drifterplanet.com/things-i-learned-about-german-people-after-moving-to-germany/) during their work hours. They really do work like machines because being efficient is in their blood. 

## Silence on Buses or Trains

Berlin Train Station

Things may be different in bigger cities that are international, but when you travel within a smaller city or a town, you will notice how silent the public places are. Coming from India, this was a big change because on a train in India, you'd normally hear a few people talking excitedly and loudly, a group laughing, somewhere a kid whining and his mother yelling.

Most of the Germans don't talk loudly and if they are in a public place, they observe an unwritten but mutually understood rule that they'd lower their voices to a level that no one else can hear them. 

I do remember traveling with a group of blogger friends on a train in Berlin and all of us were from different countries. Someone from the USA, someone else from the UK, a couple from Spain, and me from India. Yes, all from the countries where people talk loudly. Of course we were the loudest group on the train but we weren't even talking loudly.

## Getting a Doctors Appointment Isn't Always Easy

This isn't always the case but  it happens a lot. Don't be surprised if it takes you 6 months to get an appointment with a doctor. Because it is 6 months away, you are highly likely going to forget it and miss it. Good luck getting another appointment within the next few months. 

## Lovely Old Towns with Fachwerkhäuser

Typical Old Town in Germany with Old Towns with Fachwerkhäuser

Most of the people who travel to Germany end up visiting the most expensive and touristy cities like Munich, Frankfurt, [Heidelberg](https://drifterplanet.com/things-to-do-in-heidelberg-germanys/), [Hamburg](https://drifterplanet.com/things-to-do-in-hamburg-germany/) or Cologne. No doubt these cities are lovely but so are the smaller towns. 

No matter where you live in Germany, you are never going to be far from old town areas and traditional timber framed houses a.k.a. Fachwerkhäuser. Even my completely under the radar boring town has two breathtaking old town areas with some historical houses. Some of the houses are from as early as 1300 AD.

The old town areas are super dreamy and they will make you feel like you're starring in your own romantic movie. You will most likely find old buildings, small shops with lovely but expensive handmade things, benches strategically places in scenic spots and an amazing atmosphere.

Talking about the timber framed houses, yes – they exist in other countries too. BUT, as per wikipedia, the country that's most known for these kind of houses is (drumroll) – [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_framing#German_tradition_(Fachwerkh%C3%A4user)).

## The Language

If you're [traveling within Germany](https://drifterplanet.com/germany/) then you will not really face a lot of language barriers. It is only when you start living in the country, you will realize that you will need to learn more than just the basic level German to do things here. I'm talking about paperwork, visiting different government offices like the town hall, tax office, etc.

In order to live in Germany, most of the visas have a prerequisite of basic German language skills. Trust me, you NEED to learn the basic level German, else you will feel stuck.

If you know English, then learning basic German isn't that difficult because many nouns and verbs are same. What's different is how the verbs are used and the endless articles. The good thing is, that German words sound exactly how they are written, which can't be said about a lot of English words. The bad thing is that German language is highly complicated if you compare it to English.

Honestly, it doesn't matter if you slightly mess up the grammar. If you make an effort to speak a few sentences in German then the locals will highly appreciate it and help you.

## Paperwork Never Ends

Get ready to drown in a lot of paperwork if you end up living in Germany. Yes, paperwork exists in every country but in Germany it seems to never get over.

If you live in Germany, you will notice that there's something new that comes up every month that needs immediate attention. Hence, more paperwork. Thankfully, the paperwork in Germany is pretty straightforward because all the rules and procedures are always black or white. 

## The Food in Germany

Food in Germany – Schnitzel

Potatoes, meat, eggs, bread and dairy are things that truly rule the German food scene. If you eat in a restaurant in Germany, you will find very limited vegan food options unless it is an Asian restaurant.

In India and many other Asian countries you will find an entire section of vegetarian and vegan dishes, even if it is burgers. I have spent 3 months in the USA and I always noticed a lot of veggie items in the menu too. In comparison, here in Germany you will notice barely 1-2 dishes in the entire menu that are vegetarian and just one out of that would be vegan. 

However, when it comes to the availability of vegetables and fruits in the supermarkets, then Germany is awesome. Even the smaller super markets in small towns have German as well as a lot of international produce so you can find almost anything. If you love vegetables as much as I do, you are going to really enjoy cooking while you live in Germany. I didn't know I could cook before I arrived in Germany!

## Trains are Good BUT Expensive

German trains are awesome. They are clean, comfortable, 98% on time and extremely fast. You can travel very easily within Germany and nearby countries on trains. But they aren't cheap.

It is sometimes cheaper to take a flight than travel by train. In many cases, if you're looking for an affordable train ticket, you may have to change trains a few times in your journey.

## Bicycle Will be Your Best Friend

Cycling in Germany in Spring

Forget driving, or buses but the best way of getting around in Germany is on a bicycle. The bike lanes are everywhere and in many cases you can take an inside "walking / cycle only" path that's more scenic. You can also take your bicycle on a train and travel to other places within Europe. San and I once also traveled to [Amsterdam](https://drifterplanet.com/amsterdam-travel-tips/) from our town in Germany on our bicycles.

Carry a lock, learn how to take care of your bicycle and enjoy riding one. 

## You Can Travel all Over Europe

Us three with van in [Croatia](https://drifterplanet.com/croatia-road-trip-itinerary/) – we drove all over Europe with our camper van

I'm sure other Europeans who are reading this would just say – "yeah of course", but for a non European the ease of traveling within Europe is unbelievable. Yes, one of the best things about living in Germany is the possibly of reaching a new country in just a couple of hours. Not just by air but very easily by road or train without any need for visa paperwork. 

Depending on where you live in Germany, a few hours of driving can take you to Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, or the Czechia. If you take a flight, you can reach most of the European countries in just 2 hours. How awesome is that? San and I ended up [traveling in most of Europe on our camper van](https://drifterplanet.com/europe-by-campervan/) while living in Germany. Check out our post about the [most beautiful lakes in Europe](https://drifterplanet.com/most-beautiful-lakes-in-europe/).

## Tap Water is Safe for Drinking

The [tap water in Germany is safe for drinking](https://tappwater.co/en/can-i-drink-tap-water-in-germany-2/) even in big cities. It is the most controlled beverage in Germany and it should be. I wish it was the same all over the world. Everyone should have the access to clean and safe drinking water from their taps.

Strangely enough, not many Germans that I know drink tap water. They buy bottled water or carbonated drinks and choose to drink that over tap water despite its consequences on the planet (and their health).

Tap water gets tested periodically to check the quality and as per many reports it is as good and sometimes even better than the bottled mineral water. 

## BUT You Can Never Order Tap Water in Restaurants. Never.

For a country where the tap water is safe for drinking, it is super strange that you can never ask for a glass of it in a restaurant. You are expected to order drinks with your meal and water isn't always cheap. Also, bottled water creates unnecessary plastic waste. 

## If You Ask for Water, You Will Most Likely Get Soda

For non-Europeans, water means just water. But that's not the case with most of the Europeans. If you order water in a restaurant or ask for it somewhere, you will get a glass or a bottle of soda. In some places, they're nice enough to ask if you want your water with or without bubbles. No, plain water doesn't have bubbles, that's soda. 

## Highways have no toll.. and no speed limit

German highways are awesome. They are very well maintained, have resting stops after every few kilometers and are toll free. The only time we remember ever paying toll was when we used a bridge that connected Germany's mainland to [Rugen island](https://drifterplanet.com/jasmund-national-park-rugen-island-germany/).

Guess what, Germany's highways are world famous and some people come come here from surrounding countries with their fancy cars. All because the highways (Autobahns) have no speed limit.

## School System is Very Weird

There are just a few things that I dislike about Germany and one of them is the school system. It is very weird and it feels wrong. There are separate schools based on the intelligence level. There is a school for very bright kids and only those who finish this school can go to college. Rest others have to go to a school that's not for the smartest kids. If they fail, they get thrown into a school that's for below average kids. 

I understand that this may be an efficient system for managing education but it is a horrible system for developing smarter all rounded children. In real life, everyone has something to learn from the other. When children aren't given the opportunity to study with those who are smarter than or not as smart as them, then they will miss out on some important life lessons.

## Customer Service Doesn't Normally Exist

You know what's the only word that comes to my mind when I think of German customer service? It's non-existent. Unlike Asia or Americas where the service mantra is that the customer is the king, in Germany it is completely different. Apart from the Deutsche Post and DHL, if you seek help from anyone at any office at any time, they will act as if they are doing YOU a big favor or they will just say no.

## You Get to Enjoy All the Seasons

Snowy Winter in Germany

You're probably thinking – huh, so that's in many other places. Yes it is but I felt a need to add this here because this is a very big deal for me. You see, while living in New Delhi (India), I thought I was experiencing every season but I realized what I was missing after moving to Germany. 

Because Germany is in the Northern Hemisphere, the winter is really cold with shorter days. It doesn't snow throughout the winter but it does snow at least once or twice per season. When it does, the world turns absolutely magical and white. Because of the extreme winter, spring feels more alive and the sudden burst of color because of the flowers is eye-popping.

Spring in Germany – Rapeseed Flower Field

The summer is warm in Germany and sometimes the temperature can go till 35-40 degree celsius. Those are the times I miss an air conditioner but I made do with a fan here. Right after summer, the autumn season is pretty intense.

Honestly, my first Autumn experience was in Germany. I never realized I was missing out on Autumn beauty in India till the time I moved to Germany. Autumn in Germany is beautiful because there are so many trees everywhere. They all turn yellow, then red and then brown. It is insanely beautiful to see autumn foliage in Germany.

## When it Snows, You Gotta Shovel the Sidewalk next to your House

No, I'm not talking about shoveling the driveway – that's something you will need to do anyway if you want to take out your car after it snows. If you live in a house then most likely it would have a sidewalk for bicycles or pedestrians. In Germany, if anyone walks on the sidewalk next to your house and hurt themself bad if they slip on the snow then it is your responsibility. So, enjoy the snow but keep shoveling the sidewalk. 

Don't get me wrong – this isn't a rant about Germany but just an observation about how life is different here than my own country. I like the fact that the residents are accountable for the area around their house in the immediate vicinity.

## Celebrations and Festivals

Carnival in Germany

I thought India had too many festivals and celebrations but Germany isn't any different. There's something that happens every month in Germany. Everyone knows about the Oktoberfest? Well that's just one of many. There's the Carnival that's crazier than anything you can imagine. It is like a psychedelic festival where everyone dresses up crazy and participates.

My First [German Christmas Market](https://drifterplanet.com/german-christmas-market-christkindlmarkt-wiedenbruck/) – Christkindlmarkt Wiedenbrück

Christmas time in Germany is like no other. Guess what, many famous international Christmas traditions actually came out of Germany., Santa Claus is from Germany too! Christmas festivities start in Germany at the end of November and last till Christmas.

There's St Martin where children walk with the lanterns. Apart from this, there are so many smaller monthly celebrations and some are region specific. In my area we celebrate Kirmes, Schützenfest, Medieval Fest, Plum festival and many wine festivals to name a few.

The only time of the year when I haven't seen any celebrations is between the New Years Eve to Carnival and that's just one month. Carnival occurs in mid February every year.

## Germany Has Bad Internet

You will find it unbelievable but you will find better internet in most places in Asia as compared to Germany. This comes as a shock because Germany is a highly advanced and developed country but the internet situation has evolved in a strange manner.

You see, Germany has an Oligopoly market situation when it comes to the internal. That means, there are just a handful of providers that rule the market. The speed is slow, service is horrible and faster internet is obscenely overprices as compared to many other countries.

## Conclusion – Life in Germany – Yay or Nay?

I didn't particularly love every aspect of living in Germany right away. It took me some time to adjust, and I kept comparing it to [life in India.](https://drifterplanet.com/life-in-india-is-awesome/) I missed the food, the color, the sensory overload and my people from India. I don't know how it happened but two years after living in Germany, I started to miss it while I was traveling in India. When I was at the airport, I felt an odd connection to people who were talking in German. This is how I usually felt when I saw Indians talking in India. 

So, for me life in Germany is definitely YAY.
